# Moorhuhn Kart 2 - File Manager

## Installation

Follow these steps to install **Moorhuhn Kart 2 - File Manager**. If you need help, watch the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/).

1. Download the application file [mhk2_manager.jar](https://github.com/Markimk13/mhk2_manager/raw/master/source/mhk2_manager.jar).
1. Search the location on your computer where you installed **Moorhuhn Kart 2**.
1. Copy the *mhk2_manager.jar* file into this location. It must be copied into the same folder as where the *MHK2-XXL.exe* file is.
1. If you needed Admin permissions in step 3, you cannot open *mhk2_manager.jar* in this location. So you have to copy the whole folder *Moorhuhn Kart 2* to your home directory or any other location where you do not need Admin permissions.
1. Execute the *mhk2_manager.jar* file. When executing it the first time, it will load some source files.
